Magic Date Calculator

**Overview**
The Magic Date Calculator is a simple C++ program that determines if a given date is "magic" 
A magic date is defined as one where the product of the month and day equals a specific value when multiplied by a constant factor. 
This project was created on November 30, 2020.

**How It Works**
The program prompts the user to input a month, day, and year. 
It then calculates whether the date is magic based on the following condition:
- If the product of the month and day, multiplied by 16.6666667, equals the year, the date is considered magic.

**Example**
If you enter the following:
- Month: 6
- Day: 10
- Year: 1000
The program will check if \(6 \times 10 \times 16.6666667 = 1000\).
If the condition is true, it will display "Your date is MAGIC!!!" Otherwise, it will display "Your date is not MAGIC."

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**
To run this program, you need:
- A C++ compiler (I use Programiz: https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/#:~:text=Write%20and%20run%20your%20C++%20code%20using%20our%20online%20compiler.)
- A development environment (I use Visual Studio)

**Running the Program**
1. Copy the source code into a `.cpp` file.
2. Compile the code using your C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the month, day, and year.
5. The program will determine if your date is magic and display the result.
